ABOUT:

Substrate is a fully-developed .NET SDK for editing Minecraft worlds. Substrate

maps and player data.
The lite version is reduced support to read, write, modify and verify NBT formats only.
Both Substrate and Substrate Lite are developed in C# as a CLS-compliant assembly.

Both Substrate and Substrate Lite are compatible with .NET Framework 2.0 or higher and Mono,
and should be compatible with any CLI language.
